# TextBasedRPG_v2
This is a simple text based game that is played in the terminal.
Be sure to have the latest version of Python installed.

The Rules of the game are simple:
- You only have one life.
- You start out in town and can enter the shop to buy a few starter potions.
   - You can also upgrade your weapon and armor for a price.

- Moving (press respective number to move in a cardinal direction) around the map on most tiles will have a chance to spawn a random enemy.
- These enemies are not leveled to the players level so you may need to flee combat a lot early on.
- There are 4 dragons located (they are very tough) on the map.
    - 2 are in caves and 2 are in crypts.
    - Bosses just like enemies, are randomly chosen up entering the given area.
    - 2 Dragons are slightly easier and 2 are harder.
    - Once all 4 dragons are defeated, the game will end and note your victory.
- There is no level cap so you can can level up as much as you want to get stronger.
